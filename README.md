It allows HR personnel to manage employee information, request and approve vacation requests, and handle employee updates. Employees can also access the system to request vacations, view their vacation status, and update their personal information.

## Features

1. **HR Management**
   - Add new employees to the system.
   - Request vacation on behalf of employees.
   - Approve or reject vacation requests.
   - Delete or edit employee information.
   - Search for employees by name or ID.

2. **Employee Self-Service**
   - Edit personal information (marital status, phone number, address).
   - Search for employees within the organization.
   - Request vacations.
   - View the status of vacation requests.
   - Review approved or rejected vacations.

## Workflow

Here's a brief overview of the workflow within the vacation requesting and approval system:

1. **HR Personnel**
   - HR personnel can log in to the system and access the HR management features.
   - They can add new employees, providing necessary details such as name, ID, position, and department.
   - HR personnel can also request vacations on behalf of employees by selecting the desired employee and specifying the vacation details.
   - They have the authority to approve or reject vacation requests from employees.
   - If a vacation request is approved, it will be deducted from the employee's available vacation days and added to the list of approved vacations.

   - They can request vacations by providing the desired dates and any additional information.
   - Employees can view the status of their vacation requests (approved, rejected, or pending).
